# About
This tool was initially created for [the German Pirate Party](https://piratenpartei.de). This repository does not contain designs and logos of the Pirate Party, example logos and designs are included instead. If you want to use this tool for your own organization, you have to create your own designs. I will add a tutorial to do this later (probably), until then, you can have a look into `src/designs/example` and start from there.

# Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. Create an `.env` file by renaming `example.env` and edit it (see below)
3. Run `npm install` in the main directory
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Visit http://localhost:3000

# Deploy
1. Change designs and logos (see below)
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Copy the contents of the `build` folder to your server
